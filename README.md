# Customer-Segmentation--Project

## Problem Statement
• A retail store that has multiple outlets across the country are facing issues in managing
the inventory - to match the demand with respect to supply. You are a data scientist,
who must come up with useful insights using the data and make prediction models to
forecast the sales for X number of months/years.

• We need find useful insights about the customer purchasing history that can be an
added advantage for the online retailer.

• Segment the customers based on their purchasing behaviour
